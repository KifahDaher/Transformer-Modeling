Transformer-Modeling
====================

This report describes MATLAB/Simulink realization of open-circuit and short-circuit tests of transformer without 
and with saturation that are performed to identify equivalent circuit parameters. The simulation models are developed 
to support and enhance Advanced Electric Machines graduate course. The proposed test has been successfully integrated 
into Advanced Electric Machines course based on the reference book: Krause, P.C. andO. Wasynczuk, Electromechanical 
Motion Devices, MacGraw-Hill, 1989/ Chapter 1 section 1.4 & 1.5 (Example 1-C).
